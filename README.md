### Hi !

I'm a french boy who started coding in 2021 and I started with the front-end, and I'm starting to learn the back-end to improve the functionality of my sites. I adore the computers science and the web. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, make calculators in Minecraft (with all logic gates) and do some sports. I'm free to do projects that will make me learn new things and advance me in the world of code.
